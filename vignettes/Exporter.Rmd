# Introduction

The [treeio](https://bioconductor.org/packages/treeio/) package supports parsing
various phylogenetic tree file formats including software outputs that contain
evolutionary evidences. Some of the formats are just log file
(*e.g.* [PAML](http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html)
and [r8s](http://ginger.ucdavis.edu/r8s) outputs), while some of the others are
non-standard formats (*e.g.* [BEAST](http://beast2.org/)
and [MrBayes](http://nbisweden.github.io/MrBayes/) outputs that introduce square
bracket, which was reserved to store comment in standard Nexus format, to store
inferences). With [treeio](https://bioconductor.org/packages/treeio/), we are
now able to parse these files to extract phylogenetic tree and map associated
data on the tree structure. Exporting the tree structure is easy, user can use
`as.phyo` method defined [treeio](https://bioconductor.org/packages/treeio/) to
convert `treedata` object to `phylo` object then using `write.tree` or
`write.nexus` implemented
in [ape](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ape/index.html) package
[@paradis_ape_2004] to export the tree structure as Newick text or Nexus file.
This is quite useful for converting non-standard formats to standard format and
for extracting tree from software outputs, such as log file, to standard tree format.


However, exporting tree with associated data is still challenging. These
associated data can be parsed from analysis programs or obtained from external
sources (*e.g.* phenotypic data, experimental data and clinical data). The major
obstacle here is that there is no standard format that designed for storing
tree with data. [NeXML](http://www.nexml.org/) [@vos_nexml:_2012] maybe the most
flexible format, however it is currently not widely supported. Most of the
analysis programs in this field rely extensively on Newick string and Nexus
format. In my opinion, although BEAST Nexus
format^[http://beast.community/nexus_metacomments] may not be the best solution,
it is currently a good approach for storing heterogeneous associated data. The
beauty of the format is that all the annotate elements are stored within square
bracket, which is reserved for comments. So that the file can be parsed as
standard Nexus by ignoring annotate elements and existing programs should be
able to read them.

# Exporting tree data


## Exporting software output to BEAST Nexus format

The [treeio](https://bioconductor.org/packages/treeio/) package provides
`write.beast` to export `treedata` object as BEAST Nexus file.
With [treeio](https://bioconductor.org/packages/treeio/), it is easy to convert
software output to BEAST format if the output can be parsed
by [treeio](https://bioconductor.org/packages/treeio/). For example, we can
convert NHX file to BEAST file and use NHX tags to color the tree using
FigTree^[http://beast.community/figtree] or convert CODEML output and use
*d~N~/d~S~*, *d~N~* or *d~S~* to color the tree in FigTree.

```{r comment=NA}
nhxfile <- system.file("extdata/NHX", "phyldog.nhx", package="treeio")
nhx <- read.nhx(nhxfile)
# write.beast(nhx, file = "phyldog.tree")
write.beast(nhx)
```

```{r comment=NA}
mlcfile <- system.file("extdata/PAML_Codeml", "mlc", package="treeio")
ml <- read.codeml_mlc(mlcfile)
# write.beast(ml, file = "codeml.tree")
write.beast(ml)
```
